 # PMSM Rapid Control Prototyping (RCP)

Here are described the steps in order to apply the control law described on page [PMSM control](../MotorModeling/PMSMControl.html)

## [Getting started](/GettingStarted)

It describes the the hardware and software requirement for this control strategie. The motor and its parameters are presented.

## [Block configuration for Motor Control](/BlockconfigurationforMotorControl.md) 

The Simulink model configuration is detailed in this page. The different inputs/outputs blocs used for motor control are described.

## Simulation Simulink models

For a successful experimental speed motor control, the control strategy was initially apllied in simulation. A simulation of the entire system is proposed in the section.

## Embedded Simulink models
